== TestFest ==

Instead of interoperability and scenarios, we will focus on REC Track testing.

An isolated local wired/wireless network provided with internet access via a NAT.
* Note we will be doing penetration testing on devices within this networks

Ports which will be open: 
* Standard TCP ports: 22 (ssh), 80 (http), 443 (https), 1883 (mqtt), 1880 (nodered)
* Test TCP ports: 8000-8200 (incl in particular 8003), 9000-9200.
* Standard UDP ports: 5683 (coap), 1194 (vpn)

Requirements for other local network behaviors?
* Peer-to-peer connections?
* Multicast: (Intel) OCF devices use UDP multicast for discovery
* UPnP?
* mDNS: (Intel) local URLs

Any other global network behaviors needed?
